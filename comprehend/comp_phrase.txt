Thank you for using our software.
Your question is probably due to a different version of Python.

Is your environment Windows or macOS or Linux?
Use the "python" command on Windows or "python3" command on macOS or Linux.
If you use the "python" command on macOS or Linux, the software may not work as expected because Python 2 starts instead of Python 3.

I hope the above measures solve the problem.
Thank you for your continued use of our software.
